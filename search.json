Other than sharing my passion with this blog, I’d like this to be a space where I can share my knowledge, like my class notes and the tinkering I’ve done as I’ve tried to grasp concepts."

When I’m not silently daydreaming, I like to study advanced physics and mathematics on my own, as well as tinkering with technology and hardware.\nIf you’d describe me with one word, it’d probably be “nerd.” Other than nerd behavior, I like playing the string bass and piano, as well as watching sunsets and taking walks. I love identifying wild native plants in the area while hiking as well."
