    "text": "Project object onto surface? ! Please note that notes from 15.4-15.6 haven’t been made yet, some stuff may need linking in here\n\nMain Question:\nFind the abs min/max of \\(f(x, y)\\) subject to a constraint, \\(g(x, y)\\) - \\(g(x, y)\\) is like a level curve, at \\(z = 0 = g(x,y)\\)\n\n\nDefining stuff\nLet \\(g\\) represent the curve that is represented by the intersection of \\(z=0\\) and \\(g(x, y)\\) \\(\\nabla f\\) - the gradient of \\(f\\), the direction at which \\(f\\) increases the most, projected onto the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane \\(\\nabla g\\) - the gradient of \\(g\\), the direction at which the ==boundary surface== increases the most (projected in \\(x\\)-\\(y\\)) - The boundary is given as a surface to aid in finding the normal to the ==boundary curve==\n\n\nVisualizing what the gradient means\nIf we make a topographical map of \\(f\\), by taking the level curve of \\(f\\) at a certain interval, the gradient vectors of the corresponding \\(z\\) value would always be normal to the level curve. - The gradient vectors are always normal to the [[15.1 Graphs and Level Curves|level curve]] at the same \\(z\\) value because you’re trying to minimize the distance to the next [[15.1 Graphs and Level Curves|level curve]] at \\(z+dz\\) , which is a straight line directly away, directly, hence normal. - By following these gradient vectors of \\(f\\) at \\(z\\) through different slices of \\(f\\) you will eventually reach an extrema\n\n\nHow are gradients used to find the extrema\nHowever we are constrained by \\(g(x, y)=0\\) (the ==boundary curve==), which, coincidentally, we also have the normal vectors to. As you follow the gradient vectors of \\(f\\) and eventually reach the edge of the ==boundary curve== without turning back into the boundary afterwards, you have reached a local extrema! - At this point, because it is a local extrema, that means that locally, at this \\(z\\) value, the boundary curve and the level curve at the same \\(z\\) value will share the same tangent - The fact that they share the same tangent, means that their normals, the ==gradient vectors==, will be pointing in the same direction. - See [[Gradient & Boundary Curve.excalidraw]] for a diagram where the ==boundary curve== only intersects once with the [[15.1 Graphs and Level Curves|level curve]]\n\n\nWorking backwards for a formula to find extrema\nTaking this logic backwards, to find the local extrema of a function \\(f(x, y)\\) constrained by a level curve of \\(g(x, y)\\) at \\(0\\) (or technically any value, but for simplicity \\(0\\)), we simply search for when \\(\\nabla f\\) is the same direction of \\(\\nabla g\\) =&gt; \\(\\nabla f = \\lambda \\nabla g\\) - The ration of \\(\\nabla f\\) and \\(\\nabla g\\) is \\(\\lambda\\) which is called the ==Lagrange Multiplier== - there is not really a physical use for this, it’s just a useful number in math. - ~={red}[!] There still may be extrema WITHIN the constraint region, which can be found normally by setting \\(f_x(x, y)\\) and \\(f_y(x, y)\\), the partials, to \\(0\\) which ensures that the tangent at that point is a flat plane (similar to Calc BC optimization)=~ -&gt; [[15.7 Optimizing Multivariable Functions|More explanation]]\nYou may refer to this hand-drawn explanation below ![[Lagrange Multiplier.png]]"
