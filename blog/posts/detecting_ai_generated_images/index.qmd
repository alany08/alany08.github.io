## Introduction
- Why care?
- Why does it matter?
- What's been happening?

## How images are generated
- Standard diffusion models
- Tie into specifically the math behind htem
- Add diagrams

## What characteristics generated images have
- What's the difference between an authentic picture and a generated one?
- Why? Tie to how they're generated

## How we can detect AI generated images
- Talk about taking FFT of the images
- Using noise residues
- How this exploits the uniqueness of AI images
